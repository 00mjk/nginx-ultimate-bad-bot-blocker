# PULL REQUEST Instructions for Nginx Bad Bot Blocker

Please send any pull requests by adding your referers to the badreferers.list file
in this directory. This helps me keep changes synchronized across both the Nginx Bad Bat Blocker
as well as the Apache Bad Bot Blocker which use this same centralised list of bad referers.

Thank you for contributing to help produce the most extensive bad bot and spam referer
blocker.
